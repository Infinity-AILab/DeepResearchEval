Semiconductor Sanctions' Impact on China, Russia Completed Aug 19, 10:24 PM Deep Research  Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it  Semiconductor Sanctions' Impact on China, Russia Contents Export Create The Chip War's Ripple Effect: Semiconductor Controls and the Divergent Technological Trajectories of China and Russia (2023-2025) Executive Summary This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the effects of semiconductor export restrictions on the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation from January 2023 to June 2025. The assessment focuses on three critical domains of state capability: state media broadcast technology, national surveillance capacity, and international narrative control. The findings reveal a starkly asymmetrical impact, driven by the differing strategic rationales of the control regimes and the vast disparity in the industrial and technological foundations of the two target nations. The US-led export controls on China are prophylactic and capability-denying, designed to slow the rise of a peer competitor in strategic technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). In contrast, the multilateral sanctions on Russia are punitive and attrition-focused, aimed at degrading an active war machine. This strategic divergence has produced profoundly different outcomes. China, while facing significant headwinds in accessing leading-edge semiconductors and manufacturing equipment, has demonstrated remarkable resilience. It has responded with a multi-pronged strategy of massive state investment, accelerated domestic innovation, and strategic retaliation. The controls have inadvertently catalyzed China's dominance in mature-node semiconductors, creating a new potential dependency for global supply chains. In the domains of state media and narrative control, China has leveraged its robust mature-node industry and sophisticated software development to continue modernizing its infrastructure and enhance its AI-driven influence operations. The primary impact has been to slow the pace of innovation for its most advanced, compute-intensive surveillance systems, rather than to degrade existing capabilities. Russia presents a case of systemic technological decay. Lacking a viable domestic semiconductor industry, its response has been limited to tactical circumvention and sanctions evasion. The withdrawal of Western technology and the inability to source or produce replacements has crippled its core digital infrastructure, most notably its SORM national surveillance system. Its state media's international broadcast reach has been severed, forcing a defensive pivot to less effective domestic online platforms. While Russia continues to engage in asymmetric information warfare, it is falling further behind China in the technological sophistication of these operations. The sanctions are not merely slowing Russia down; they are locking it into a long-term trajectory of technological stagnation and increasing dependency on China. The overall efficacy of the technology control regimes is therefore mixed. They have successfully created a significant bottleneck for China's frontier AI ambitions and have systemically degraded Russia's military-technological base. However, they have also produced unintended consequences, such as China's emerging dominance in legacy chips, and have proven less effective against software-driven threats like AI-powered disinformation. The following matrix provides a high-level summary of these divergent impacts. Table 3: Impact Assessment Matrix: China vs. Russia (Jan 2023 - June 2025) Area of Impact China Russia Broadcast Technology Low Impact / Resilient:  Modernization continues, leveraging strong domestic mature-node chip supply. AI integration is accelerating for content generation. High Impact / Degraded:  International broadcast reach severed by bans. Hardware infrastructure is stagnating due to lack of Western parts, forcing a defensive pivot to less-capable domestic online platforms. Surveillance Capacity Medium Impact / Pacing Constraint:  Existing vast camera network is unaffected. However, development of next-generation, compute-intensive AI analysis (\"City Brains\") is slowed by lack of access to advanced GPUs. High Impact / Systemically Degraded:  Core SORM surveillance architecture is crippled due to dependency on unserviceable Western telecommunications hardware. A progressive collapse of capability is underway. Narrative Control Low-to-Medium Impact / Resilient:  Hardware constraints on frontier model training are mitigated by software innovation, architectural efficiency, and vast data access, allowing sophisticated AI-driven influence operations to continue and evolve. Medium Impact / Adapted:  Traditional propaganda arms (RT, Sputnik) are operationally disrupted. Russia has adapted to lower-cost, asymmetric online tactics but is technologically constrained and lacks the AI sophistication of China. Export to Sheets Section 1: The Architecture of Containment: A Review of Semiconductor Export Controls To comprehend the divergent impacts on China and Russia, it is essential to first dissect the distinct architectures of the technology control regimes applied to each. The period from January 2023 to June 2025 was characterized by a significant tightening and expansion of these controls, but with fundamentally different strategic objectives. The US-led actions against China were designed as a long-term, prophylactic measure to manage the rise of a strategic competitor, while the multilateral sanctions against Russia were a near-term, punitive effort to cripple a nation engaged in active warfare. 1.1 The US-Led \"Small Yard, High Fence\" Strategy Against China The cornerstone of the technology containment policy against China is the \"small yard, high fence\" strategy: identifying a narrow set of foundational technologies critical to national security (the small yard) and erecting insurmountable barriers around them (the high fence).  [1](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military)   This strategy evolved significantly during the 2023-2025 period, moving from a focus on specific end-users to a broad, country-wide denial of key capabilities.     1.1.1 Initial Framework (October 2022) and Subsequent Tightening (2023-2025) The foundational rules established on October 7, 2022, were designed to restrict China's ability to both purchase and manufacture high-end chips critical for military applications and advanced AI.  [1](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military)   These were substantially updated and expanded on October 17, 2023, by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).  [3]   Further updates and expansions continued into 2024 and 2025, reflecting a dynamic effort to close loopholes and adapt to Chinese countermeasures.  [6]      A critical evolution in this period was the shift in strategic logic. The controls moved beyond simply restricting exports for military end-uses and began to restrict them on a geographic basis for China as a whole.  [8]   The goal was no longer merely to maintain a technological lead but to actively degrade the peak technological capability of China's semiconductor industry and prevent it from ever reaching certain advanced performance thresholds.  [8]   This was explicitly aimed at slowing China's military modernization and its ambition to become a world leader in AI by 2030, which the US views as a direct threat to its national security and foreign policy interests.  [1](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military)      1.1.2 Key Controlled Technologies The BIS rules established precise technical parameters to define the \"high fence.\" Advanced Computing Chips:  The controls targeted Integrated Circuits (ICs) based on performance metrics. Under the updated Advanced Computing and Supercomputing (AC/S) rule, ICs controlled under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 3A090 included those with a 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more, or those with lower performance but high 'performance density'.  [3]   These parameters were specifically designed to capture the high-performance Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and other AI accelerators essential for training large AI models. This forced US companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to design degraded \"workaround\" chips specifically for the Chinese market to remain compliant.  [6]      Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment (SME):  The SME rule imposed stringent license requirements on the export of critical manufacturing tools to China. This included equipment for lithography, etch, deposition, ion implantation, and metrology.  [1](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military)   The controls were designed to target chokepoint technologies where US, Japanese, and Dutch firms hold a dominant market position, thereby preventing China from building an indigenous capacity to produce advanced chips.  [6]      Memory Chips:  Specific thresholds were established for advanced memory, another key component for high-performance computing. The controls applied to DRAM memory chips of 18 nm half-pitch or less, and NAND flash memory chips with 128 layers or more.  [7]      Software and Human Capital:  The restrictions extended beyond hardware to include the software and human expertise needed for chip development. This encompassed controls on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software, which is essential for modern chip design, and a broad restriction on the ability of \"U.S. persons\" to support the development or production of advanced ICs in China without a license.  [7]      1.1.3 Jurisdictional Reach and Enforcement Mechanisms The effectiveness of the US strategy hinges on its ability to project its jurisdiction globally. The Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR):  The FDPR is the central pillar of this extraterritorial reach. It extends US export control jurisdiction to items manufactured outside the United States if they are produced using US-origin technology, software, or tools.  [2]   This rule makes it exceedingly difficult for Chinese firms to circumvent controls by sourcing from third countries, as most advanced global semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs) rely on US-designed equipment and software.  [3]   This mechanism effectively forces the global supply chain to align with US policy, as non-compliance risks being cut off from the essential tools of the trade.     The Entity List:  The US continued to add Chinese technology companies to its Entity List, imposing severe restrictions on their ability to access US technology. This list grew to include major players like Huawei, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), and Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), directly targeting China's national champions.  [2]   The rules were also expanded to apply to any company worldwide whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in a restricted country (like China), closing another potential loophole.  [3]      1.2 The Allied Front: Multilateral Controls Recognizing that unilateral controls are insufficient, the US has devoted significant resources to aligning key allies. The participation of the Netherlands, home to lithography giant ASML, and Japan, a leader in various specialized SME and materials, was crucial in transforming the US-led controls into a formidable multilateral blockade of chokepoint technologies.  [6]   While the EU's primary focus has been on Russia, its overarching framework for controlling dual-use goods and advanced technologies adds another layer of restriction that indirectly affects technology flows to China.  [11]      1.3 The Sanctions Regime Against Russia: Targeting a War Machine In contrast to the prophylactic strategy against China, the multilateral sanctions against Russia are designed to inflict immediate and ongoing economic and military attrition. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the EU, in concert with the US and other partners, implemented an unprecedented series of sanctions packages that were progressively tightened throughout 2023-2025.  [11]      Scope of Technology Sanctions:  The sanctions prohibit the sale, supply, or export of a wide range of sensitive dual-use goods and advanced technologies that could contribute to Russia's military and technological enhancement.  [11]   This explicitly includes items such as quantum computers, advanced semiconductors, electronic components, and software.  [12]   The 14th package, adopted in June 2024, further tightened these controls by adding specific items like computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools used in weapons production and, significantly, banning the import of helium from Russia, a critical gas used in semiconductor manufacturing.  [13]      Anti-Circumvention Measures:  As Russia adapted by seeking to import goods via third countries, the sanctions regime evolved to counter these evasion tactics. Later packages introduced measures requiring EU operators to include contractual clauses prohibiting the re-export of sensitive goods to Russia and began targeting entities in third countries that were found to be aiding in circumvention efforts.  [11]   This reflects a shift from simply banning direct trade to actively disrupting Russia's gray market supply chains.     The fundamental difference in these two approaches is clear. The controls on China are a long-term strategic wager on slowing innovation in a rising peer competitor. The sanctions on Russia are a near-term tactical effort to break the supply chains of an active adversary, degrading its ability to sustain its war effort.  [15]   This distinction in intent is the primary driver of the divergent outcomes analyzed throughout this report.     1.4 Table 1: Timeline of Key Semiconductor Export Controls and Sanctions (Jan 2023 - June 2025) Date Acting Body/Country Target Country Key Action July 2023 China Global Imposed export restrictions on critical minerals gallium and germanium.

[12]      June 24, 2024 European Union Russia Adopted 14th sanctions package, adding CNC machine tools to restricted list and banning helium imports from Russia.  [12]      Dec 2024 China United States Banned exports of gallium, germanium, and antimony to the US in retaliation for chip sanctions.  [2]      Dec 2024 US (BIS) China Released new rules adding 140 companies to Entity List and restricting high-bandwidth memory (HBM).  [1](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military)      Jan 2025 US (Commerce) China Issued AI Diffusion Framework and Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping technology spread.  [7]      July 2025 European Union Russia Adopted 18th sanctions package, tightening restrictions on software and targeting entities involved in sanctions evasion.  [12]      Section 2: China's Response: Resilience, Retaliation, and the Pursuit of Self-Sufficiency China's reaction to the escalating semiconductor export controls has been a multifaceted and determined campaign to achieve technological self-reliance. Far from capitulating, Beijing has treated the restrictions as a catalyst, accelerating a long-standing industrial policy aimed at breaking its dependency on foreign technology. The period from 2023 to 2025 marked a crucial inflection point, where China's strategy matured from tactical adaptation to a confident, long-term push to build a complete, de-Americanized semiconductor ecosystem. 2.1 The \"Made in China 2025\" Imperative: Assessing Domestic Capabilities The foundation of China's response is the \"Made in China 2025\" (MIC25) industrial plan, which predates the most severe controls and identifies semiconductors as a core strategic priority.  [18]   The explicit goal is to increase the domestic content of core materials and achieve 70% self-sufficiency in semiconductors by 2025, a target that has gained renewed urgency in the face of US pressure.  [18]      Massive State Investment:  To achieve this, Beijing has mobilized immense financial resources. The primary vehicle is the National Integrated Circuits Industry Development Investment Fund, or \"Big Fund,\" which in its first two phases committed over $50 billion, with a third phase in 2024 adding another $47.1 billion.  [21]   Combined with local government funds and other state-backed financing, total investment in the sector since 2014 is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, an unmatched level of state support globally.  [18]      Progress in Mature-Node Semiconductors (>=28nm):  This investment has yielded substantial results in less advanced, or \"mature-node,\" semiconductors. By leveraging state support and its vast domestic market, China has successfully built a formidable, and increasingly dominant, position in this segment.  [19]   Domestic firms have achieved high self-sufficiency in key production processes like photoresist stripping, cleaning, and etching.  [21]   Projections suggest that by 2030, China's domestic fab capacity could cover approximately 90% of its internal demand for these chips, which are the workhorses of the automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics sectors.  [24]   This progress has been a direct consequence of being blocked from the leading edge; capital and talent that might have gone to developing 7nm processes have been redirected to perfecting and scaling up 28nm and older nodes. This has created a \"waterbed effect,\" where pressure on one area of the industry causes another to swell, potentially leading to a global oversupply of mature chips that could allow China to dominate the market through subsidized pricing, similar to what occurred with solar panels.  [19]      Bottlenecks at the Leading Edge (<16/14nm):  Despite this progress, China remains critically dependent on foreign technology for manufacturing the most advanced chips. The primary chokepoints are extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, for which Dutch firm ASML holds a monopoly, and advanced EDA software, which is dominated by US firms like Synopsys and Cadence.  [6]   These are the core vulnerabilities that the multilateral export controls are designed to exploit, and they represent a multi-year, if not decade-long, hurdle for China's indigenous efforts.  [26]      Domestic Champions:  In response, China is cultivating a roster of national champions to lead the self-sufficiency drive. Key players include SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor in manufacturing; Huawei, through its HiSilicon design arm and Ascend AI chip division, in advanced design; and firms like Naura Technology Group and AMEC in the domestic SME sector.  [7]   Huawei's development of the 7-nanometer Ascend 910B chip, which has been shown to rival the performance of Nvidia's sanctioned A100 GPU in some benchmarks, is a landmark achievement, demonstrating China's capacity for indigenous innovation even under extreme pressure.  [29]      2.2 Mitigating the Chokehold: Adaptation and Innovation Faced with an immediate shortage of advanced chips, Chinese firms have pursued a range of mitigation strategies. Circumvention and Gray Markets:  In the short term, Chinese companies have engaged in stockpiling chips ahead of new restrictions and have turned to gray markets to acquire sanctioned hardware.  [28]   Reports from 2024 estimated that as many as 140,000 high-performance Nvidia GPUs were smuggled into China, often transshipped through third countries.  [10]   Chinese firms have also leveraged US-based cloud computing services to remotely access the processing power of banned chips, a \"cloud loophole\" that US regulators have subsequently sought to close.  [28]      Architectural Innovation:  A more sustainable and strategic adaptation has been a pivot towards software and architectural innovation to maximize the performance of available, less-advanced hardware. Chinese AI firms have focused on developing more efficient algorithms and model architectures, such as Mixture-of-Experts, to achieve competitive performance without relying on cutting-edge chips.  [31]   The success of open-source AI models from companies like DeepSeek, which have benchmarked favorably against leading US models, demonstrates that raw compute power is not the sole determinant of AI progress.  [31]      The \"Sanctioned Chip\" Dilemma:  This growing confidence in domestic capabilities led to a significant strategic shift in 2025. Initially, Chinese tech giants were major customers for the lower-performance \"workaround\" chips designed by Nvidia, such as the H20.  [33]   However, by August 2025, Chinese authorities began actively discouraging domestic firms, including ByteDance and Tencent, from purchasing these chips.  [33]   Citing national data security concerns and the need to support domestic suppliers, Beijing signaled a clear preference for homegrown alternatives like Huawei's Ascend series.  [28]   This move represents a crucial evolution from merely surviving sanctions to actively building a self-reliant technological future, even at the cost of some short-term performance trade-offs.  [30]      2.3 Counter-Leverage: Waging the Tech War China has not merely played defense; it has also used its own dominant position in other parts of the technology supply chain to retaliate and create counter-leverage. Control of Critical Minerals:  In a direct response to US controls, China weaponized its control over key industrial minerals. In July 2023, it placed export restrictions on gallium and germanium, and in December 2024, it banned their export to the United States entirely, along with antimony.  [2]   These minerals are indispensable for manufacturing semiconductors, defense technologies, and green energy products. This move sent a strong signal to Washington that Beijing is willing to escalate the tech war by exploiting US vulnerabilities.  [2]      Calibrated Response:  Analysis of trade data reveals that China's mineral export bans have not been absolute. While direct exports to the US and its allies plummeted, exports to intermediary countries like Belgium surged, suggesting that some material is still reaching Western markets through third-country re-exports.  [16]   This indicates a calibrated strategy designed to inflict economic pain and send a political message without completely severing global supply chains, thereby preserving some leverage for future negotiations.     Section 3: Russia's Response: Circumvention, Stagnation, and Asymmetric Adaptation Russia's response to technology sanctions presents a stark contrast to China's strategic industrial mobilization. Lacking a competitive domestic semiconductor industry and a coherent long-term strategy, Russia's efforts have been almost entirely tactical, focused on immediate circumvention to feed its war machine. The result, from 2023 to 2025, has been a progressive hollowing-out of its technological base, setting the country on a path of accelerating decay and deepening dependency. 3.1 The Limits of a Legacy Industry: Domestic Production Under Sanctions Russia's indigenous semiconductor industry is a relic of the Soviet era, technologically lagging by decades and wholly incapable of meeting the country's needs. Technological Backwardness:  The country's primary chip manufacturers, Mikron and Angstrem, operate at mature process nodes of 90nm and older.  [35]   Even this rudimentary production is critically dependent on a steady flow of Western-made spare parts, materials, and equipment, which are now subject to sanctions.  [37]   While the government has set ambitious targets—such as mass-producing 28nm chips by 2028—these are widely seen as unachievable given the immense technological and investment gap.  [35]      Nascent Lithography Efforts:  A case in point is Russia's effort to develop its own lithography equipment. In May 2024, it announced the assembly of its first domestically produced lithography machine, capable of producing chips at a 350nm process node.  [40]   While an impressive feat of engineering under severe sanctions, this technology is commercially obsolete by about 30 years and is suitable only for the most basic applications in sectors like automotive and energy.  [40]   Plans to develop a 130nm machine by 2026 further highlight the vast chasm between Russia's capabilities and the global state-of-the-art, which is at 3nm and below.  [35]      Quality Control Crisis:  Beyond the technological gap, Russia's domestic production is crippled by a systemic industrial collapse. Reports from within Russia indicate that domestically packaged chips suffer from catastrophic defect rates, with some sources claiming that 40% to 50% of processors are faulty.  [36]   This is not merely a technical issue; it is a symptom of a failing ecosystem, plagued by a lack of access to high-purity materials, poorly maintained legacy equipment, and a severe shortage of skilled personnel.  [41]   This makes scaling up reliable production for critical military or industrial use a near-impossible task.     3.2 Sanction Evasion Networks: The Gray Market Lifeline With domestic production non-viable, Russia's primary survival strategy has been to establish and rely on complex global networks for sanction evasion. Third-Country Intermediaries:  The core of this strategy is \"parallel imports\"—the acquisition of Western-made chips and electronics through intermediary countries that have not joined the sanctions regime. Key hubs for this gray market trade include Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, and, most importantly, China.  [38]   These networks allow Russia to procure some necessary components, but this comes at a steep price. Customs data shows that Russia is paying nearly double its pre-war prices for semiconductors, and the supply chains are inherently unreliable and vulnerable to Western enforcement actions.  [38]      China as the Primary Supplier:  Since the full-scale invasion, China has become Russia's technological lifeline, with over 80% of its chip imports now originating from or passing through the PRC.  [38]   However, this dependency is fraught with problems. Russian end-users have reported failure rates as high as 40% for Chinese-supplied chips, compared to a pre-war rate of 2%, leading to speculation that China may be dumping defective or lower-grade products into the Russian market.  [36]      Cannibalization and Repurposing:  The unreliability of gray market imports has forced Russia into desperate and unsustainable measures. To keep its military and aviation sectors running, it has resorted to cannibalizing parts from its civilian aircraft fleet and repurposing semiconductors from imported consumer appliances like refrigerators and cars for use in military systems.  [15]   This is a clear indicator of a defense industry under extreme duress, forced to degrade its civilian infrastructure to sustain its war effort.     3.3 The \"Technology Museum\" Effect Unlike China, which is using sanctions as a catalyst for innovation, Russia is locked in a cycle of decline. The withdrawal of major Western technology firms like Nokia, Ericsson, Cisco, and Microsoft has severed its access to crucial updates, maintenance, and new equipment.  [45]   This has effectively frozen Russia's telecommunications infrastructure in time, halting its planned 5G rollout and causing its existing networks to degrade slowly.  [46]   Analysts have described this as Russia turning into a \"failing technology museum,\" where legacy systems are kept running through ad-hoc fixes and cannibalized parts until they inevitably break down.  [46]   This long-term decay, compounded by a significant \"brain drain\" of tech talent, distinguishes Russia's predicament from China's. Russia is not just being slowed down; its technological capacity is being systemically and perhaps irreversibly dismantled.     3.4 Table 2: Comparative Analysis of Domestic Semiconductor Capabilities: China vs. Russia (June 2025) Metric China Russia State Investment (2023-2025 est.) >$100 Billion (via Big Fund, etc.)   [19]      ~$3-5 Billion (via national programs)   [35]      Leading Domestic Firms SMIC, Hua Hong (Manufacturing); Huawei/HiSilicon (Design)   [7]      Mikron, Angstrem (Manufacturing)   [35]      Most Advanced Mass Production Node 7nm (via DUV multi-patterning); volume production at 14nm   [29]      90nm (with high defect rates)   [35]      Domestic Lithography Capability SMEE (DUV, for ~28nm nodes)   [21]      350nm prototype machine   [40]      Key Dependencies EUV Lithography (ASML); Advanced EDA Software (US)   [26]      All foreign SME, spare parts, high-purity materials, EDA software   [37]      Strategic Goal Global Leadership & Technological Sovereignty   [18]      Military Import Substitution & Tactical Survival   [35]      Section 4: Impact Analysis on State Media and Broadcast Technology The divergent technological trajectories of China and Russia are clearly reflected in the capabilities and strategic postures of their respective state media apparatuses. While semiconductor restrictions have created challenges for both, the impacts have been fundamentally different. China has leveraged its industrial might to continue a path of indigenous modernization, whereas Russia has been forced into a reactive adaptation, sacrificing international reach to secure domestic control. 4.1 China: The Push for Domestic Hardware and AI Integration For China's state media outlets, such as China Central Television (CCTV) and Xinhua News Agency, the direct impact of semiconductor export controls on their core broadcast operations has been minimal. Sourcing Legacy Chips for Broadcasting:  The vast majority of broadcast equipment—including cameras, video switchers, encoders, and transmitters—relies on well-established, mature-node semiconductors rather than cutting-edge chips.  [22]   This is a crucial distinction, as it aligns perfectly with China's area of industrial strength. With a dominant and rapidly growing domestic capacity for producing mature-node chips (28nm and above), China's state media can source the necessary components from a secure and sanction-proof indigenous supply chain.  [19]   This insulates their fundamental hardware infrastructure from Western pressure.     Accelerated AI Integration:  The more significant impact of the controls relates to the use of AI. While access to top-tier GPUs for  training  the largest and most complex AI models is constrained, this has not halted the aggressive  integration  of generative AI into media workflows. Since 2023, China has seen a surge in the development of localized Large Language Models (LLMs).  [47]   State media outlets are actively collaborating with tech firms to apply these domestic AI technologies for content creation, automated journalism, and audience engagement, viewing it as a paradigm shift in news production.  [47]   This focus on software and application-level innovation allows them to advance their capabilities even with less-than-optimal hardware.     Infrastructure Upgrades Continue:  The resilience of the underlying hardware supply chain means that broad infrastructure modernization projects have continued unabated. Between 2023 and 2025, China rolled out a nationwide campaign to simplify and improve the television viewing experience for 285 million households, introducing new universal remote controls and integrated set-top boxes.  [49]   This demonstrates that restrictions targeting the high-performance computing sector have not impeded consumer-facing technology rollouts in the broadcast industry.     4.2 Russia: Operational Disruption and the Forced Pivot to Online Platforms In stark contrast, Russia's state media has faced severe operational challenges that have forced a fundamental strategic reorientation. Hardware Stagnation:  The systemic technological decay affecting Russia's entire economy directly impacts its broadcast infrastructure. Unable to legally import Western equipment or the components needed to service existing systems, Russian state broadcasters face a future of hardware stagnation.  [15]   The reliance on unreliable gray market imports and cannibalized parts suggests a steady degradation in the quality and reliability of their production and transmission equipment over time.  [41]      Sanctions on Broadcasters (RT, Sputnik):  The most direct and devastating blow has been the EU's ban on the broadcasting activities of RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik.  [50]   This measure, enacted in March 2022 and upheld and enforced throughout the 2023-2025 period, severed their access to European cable, satellite, and internet TV distribution networks, effectively crippling their primary mission of reaching Western audiences.  [52]   This was a sanction targeting distribution, not production, but its effect was to render much of their content irrelevant to its intended international audience.     Forced Digital Transition:  In response to being de-platformed from traditional international media, the Kremlin has been forced into a strategic retreat. It has aggressively promoted domestic online platforms, primarily RuTube and VK Video, as alternatives to global giants like YouTube.  [54]   This has been a two-pronged effort: poaching popular creators with financial incentives while simultaneously using repressive measures, such as throttling traffic to YouTube and passing laws to demonetize content from \"foreign agents,\" to degrade the user experience on Western platforms.  [54]   While these tactics have successfully driven some traffic to domestic platforms—with RuTube and VK Video reportedly overtaking YouTube in daily traffic by May 2025—it represents a Pyrrhic victory. The primary purpose of RT and Sputnik was to conduct an information offensive abroad; by being forced to retreat into a walled-off domestic digital ecosystem, they have effectively conceded a strategic mission failure in the international arena.  [53]      4.3 Comparative Assessment: Divergent Paths in Technological Modernization The comparison reveals two starkly different paths. China's state media is undergoing an  indigenous modernization. It is insulated from hardware restrictions by a powerful domestic industrial base and is actively pushing the technological frontier in AI-driven content generation. Russia's state media is in a state of  forced adaptation and strategic retreat. Its traditional broadcast capabilities are being attrited by sanctions and technological decay, forcing a reactive and technologically constrained pivot to a domestic online sphere, sacrificing global influence for internal control. Section 5: Impact Analysis on National Surveillance Capacity The effectiveness of a modern surveillance state is increasingly dependent on its technological backbone—from the ubiquity of its sensors to the sophistication of the AI that analyzes the data they collect. The semiconductor controls have had a profound, albeit different, impact on the surveillance capacities of both China and Russia, creating a pacing problem for the former and triggering a systemic collapse in the latter. 5.1 China: Compute Constraints on Frontier AI for Social Control China has constructed the most extensive and technologically advanced mass surveillance system in the world, but its future evolution is now directly constrained by export controls. The impact can be understood by separating the system into two tiers: data collection and data analysis. Robust Data Collection Infrastructure:  The data collection layer, consisting of hundreds of millions of CCTV cameras and other sensors, remains largely immune to the controls. The manufacturers of this hardware, such as the partially state-owned giants Hikvision and Dahua, produce devices that rely on mature-node semiconductors.  [56]   As established, this is a market segment where China has a strong and growing domestic supply, insulating the physical expansion of its surveillance network from foreign pressure. Despite US sanctions and bans on their use in government facilities, these companies continue to dominate the global market, indicating a secure production base.  [58]      The Compute Bottleneck for AI Analysis:  The critical vulnerability lies in the data analysis layer. Ambitious projects like \"Police Cloud\" and \"City Brains\" aim to integrate and analyze data streams from millions of sensors in real-time, using AI to track individuals, predict behavior, and manage urban populations.  [56]   These tasks require immense computational power, the kind provided by the high-end Nvidia GPUs that are now banned for export to China.  [30]   This lack of access to elite AI accelerators creates a direct bottleneck. Chinese AI firms involved in these projects explicitly complain of being \"compute constrained,\" which forces them to ration processing power and has caused delays in model development and deployment.  [30]      Trade-offs and Mitigation:  The impact is therefore a  slowing of the pace of innovation  at the frontier of surveillance AI. China can maintain and even expand its existing surveillance operations, but its ability to develop and deploy the next generation of more sophisticated, predictive, and all-encompassing AI-driven social control systems is being hampered. To mitigate this, Beijing is pushing for the development of domestic GPUs like Huawei's Ascend series and encouraging software innovations to get more performance out of less powerful hardware.  [30]   However, these domestic alternatives still lag in both performance and production volume, meaning the compute gap will likely persist for several years.  [30]      5.2 Russia: The Systemic Degradation of the SORM Architecture For Russia, the impact of technology sanctions on its surveillance capacity has been nothing short of catastrophic. Its primary tool of digital control, the System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM), is facing a slow-motion collapse. Critical Dependency on Western Technology:  Unlike China's largely indigenous system, Russia's SORM was built and maintained almost entirely on Western telecommunications hardware.  [45]   The core infrastructure of Russia's internet and mobile networks, which the SORM system piggybacks on to intercept communications and block websites, is composed of routers, switches, and base stations from companies like Nokia, Ericsson, and Cisco.  [45]   This created a critical, systemic dependency that the post-2022 sanctions regime has fully exploited.     \"Crippling\" Impact of Withdrawals:  The complete withdrawal of these Western firms from the Russian market has had a \"devastating blow\" on SORM's viability.  [45]   Without access to official software updates, maintenance, and spare parts, the existing hardware is accumulating \"technological debt\".  [46]   The system is becoming progressively less effective, more prone to failure, and unable to cope with modern data traffic and encryption standards. This degradation directly undermines the Federal Security Service's (FSB) ability to conduct comprehensive electronic surveillance.  [45]      Inability to Substitute:  Russia's predicament is compounded by its inability to produce domestic replacements. Its own electronics industry cannot manufacture the sophisticated networking equipment required to maintain a modern telecommunications grid.  [37]   Even turning to China is not a viable solution. Chinese tech giants like Huawei, wary of secondary sanctions and dependent on global supply chains themselves, have curtailed new business in Russia, leaving the Kremlin with no clear path to replacing the decaying Western infrastructure.  [46]   The result is a progressive and likely irreversible hollowing-out of the state's central nervous system for digital surveillance and control. This decay represents a fundamental threat to the Kremlin's ability to monitor its population and suppress dissent, potentially forcing it to rely on more overt and brutal forms of repression as its technological edge erodes.     5.3 Comparative Assessment: A Widening Capabilities Gap The contrast between the two nations' surveillance capabilities is stark and growing. China faces a  pacing problem : its already formidable surveillance state continues to function effectively, but its ambition to lead the world in AI-driven social control is being slowed. Russia faces a problem of  systemic collapse : its core surveillance infrastructure is actively degrading, with no viable path to recovery. The sanctions are not just preventing Russia from advancing; they are pushing it backward, dismantling its digital panopticon from within. Section 6: Impact Analysis on International Narrative Control In the modern geopolitical landscape, the ability to shape international narratives is a critical element of state power. Both China and Russia have invested heavily in technology-driven information warfare, but semiconductor export controls have had a discernible, though again asymmetrical, impact on their respective capabilities. The restrictions have reinforced China's path toward a sophisticated, AI-integrated influence machine while pushing Russia further toward asymmetric, resource-constrained tactics. 6.1 China: Sustaining Sophisticated AI-Driven Influence Operations China's approach to international narrative control is systemic, long-term, and increasingly reliant on cutting-edge technology. While chip controls present a challenge, they have not fundamentally derailed this strategy. AI as a Force Multiplier:  China has fully embraced AI as a tool for its global influence campaigns. State-backed actors use AI to generate vast quantities of propaganda content, manipulate social media algorithms to amplify pro-Beijing narratives, and create divisive content targeting foreign audiences.  [62]   The development of advanced domestic AI models like DeepSeek, which can be tailored to reinforce state narratives while filtering out politically sensitive topics, provides a powerful, indigenous tool for these operations.  [31]      Hardware Constraints Mitigated by Software:  The efficacy of the chip controls is limited in this domain. While training the largest, most advanced AI models from scratch is a compute-intensive task affected by the GPU shortage, the  deployment  of already-trained models for tasks like text generation, image creation, and social media bot activity is significantly less demanding.  [30]   China's rapid progress in AI software, its innovative model architectures, and its unparalleled access to vast domestic datasets allow it to develop and deploy highly effective influence tools despite hardware limitations.  [31]   The open-source nature of much AI research further allows Chinese developers to build upon global advancements, mitigating the impact of being cut off from the absolute leading edge of hardware.     The Digital Silk Road:  A crucial element of China's strategy is the integration of its narrative control efforts with its technological exports. Through initiatives like the Digital Silk Road, China has embedded its technology into the critical infrastructure of nations across the globe.  [64]   This includes telecommunications networks built by Huawei and ZTE, government-sponsored logistics data platforms like LOGINK, and a dominant share of the global Internet of Things (IoT) market.  [61]   This creates a powerful ecosystem for both overt and covert influence, allowing Beijing to shape information environments and collect data in ways that are independent of its access to the latest Western chips.     6.2 Russia: Adapting Disinformation for a Resource-Constrained Environment Russia's information warfare capabilities have been more directly affected by sanctions, forcing an adaptation toward more targeted and asymmetric methods. Shift to Asymmetric Tactics:  With the international reach of its primary propaganda outlets, RT and Sputnik, severely curtailed by broadcast bans, Russia has shifted its focus to more covert and lower-cost online operations.  [53]   This strategy relies less on technological superiority and more on exploiting social and political fissures within target countries. Tactics include the use of proxy websites, fake online personas, and a vast ecosystem of front organizations to obscure the Kremlin's involvement.  [65]   A key effort noted in 2024 involved using a front company to covertly recruit unwitting American social media influencers to spread Russian narratives.  [66]      Lagging in AI Investment:  Russia is not a major player in the global AI race. Its government and private sector investment in AI research and development is a small fraction of that in the US and China.  [67]   While the Kremlin has ambitions to use AI to \"hyperpower\" its disinformation campaigns, its actual capacity to develop and deploy sophisticated, large-scale AI tools for this purpose is severely limited by its overall technological backwardness and economic constraints.  [67]   Its operations are more characterized by a high degree of familiarity with Western culture and politics, allowing for effective, manually crafted messaging, rather than AI-driven scale.  [68]      Convergence with Chinese Narratives:  In the absence of overwhelming technological capacity, Russia's information operations have increasingly found common cause with China's. Both countries actively promote anti-Western narratives, depict the US as a declining power, and seek to discredit democratic institutions.  [63]   Chinese state media often amplifies Russian talking points, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine, creating a symbiotic relationship that presents a united authoritarian front in the global information space.  [68]      6.3 Comparative Assessment: China's Systemic Campaign vs. Russia's Guerilla Warfare The period from 2023 to 2025 has seen the emergence of a clear \"disinformation capability gap\" between the two nations. China is executing a long-term, systemic strategy to build a global, AI-enhanced influence machine integrated with its technological and economic footprint. Chip restrictions act as a brake on the development of its most advanced tools but do not stop the machine itself. Russia, by contrast, is engaged in information  guerilla warfare. Its capabilities have been degraded, forcing it to rely on opportunistic, disruptive, and often covert tactics that are more dependent on human operators and cultural savvy than on technological dominance. The sanctions have effectively reinforced Russia's role as an asymmetric actor in the information domain, while China continues its march toward becoming a full-spectrum information superpower. Section 7: Strategic Outlook and Recommendations The analysis of the period from January 2023 to June 2025 reveals that semiconductor export controls have successfully reshaped the technological landscape, creating divergent futures for China and Russia. However, the policy's successes are matched by significant unintended consequences and limitations that require a strategic adjustment from Western policymakers. 7.1 Projecting Future Trajectories (2025-2030) China's Path to Partial Self-Sufficiency:  China's trajectory is one of increasing resilience and focused advancement. By 2030, it is highly probable that China will achieve near-total self-sufficiency in mature-node semiconductors (28nm and above) and will have become the dominant global supplier in this segment.  [21]   This will grant it significant leverage over global supply chains for automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics. In advanced AI, China will continue to mitigate hardware constraints through software and architectural innovation, likely remaining a close second to the United States in overall capability.  [30]   The primary and most durable bottleneck will remain leading-edge chip manufacturing (sub-7nm), where the lack of access to EUV lithography will likely keep it 3-5 years behind the technological frontier.     Russia's Deepening Dependency and Decay:  Russia's technological trajectory is one of accelerating decline and isolation. Its domestic industry is incapable of reversing the technological stagnation imposed by sanctions.  [41]   By 2030, Russia will be almost entirely dependent on China for access to any form of modern semiconductor technology, solidifying its position as a junior partner and technological client state. Its telecommunications and surveillance infrastructure will continue to degrade, and its military will be forced to rely on older, less sophisticated systems or whatever components it can procure through illicit channels.  [15]      7.2 Efficacy of Export Controls: A Balanced Assessment The technology control regime has proven to be a powerful but imperfect tool of statecraft. Successes:  The controls have been unequivocally successful in denying both nations access to the global state-of-the-art in semiconductor technology. For China, this has created a significant and durable bottleneck, slowing its progress in developing frontier AI models and high-performance computing, which was a primary policy objective.  [9]   For Russia, the impact has been even more profound, effectively crippling its military-industrial complex's ability to produce advanced weaponry and leading to the systemic degradation of its core surveillance infrastructure.  [15]      Failures and Unintended Consequences:  The policy's limitations are equally clear. The controls have been less effective at preventing Russia from acquiring older, dual-use technologies through well-established evasion networks, though they have succeeded in raising the cost and friction of doing so.  [38]   Most significantly, the \"high fence\" around advanced chips for China has had the unintended \"waterbed effect\" of channeling immense state investment into mature-node production, setting the stage for Chinese dominance in that market and creating a new strategic vulnerability for the West.  [19]   Furthermore, the controls have had a limited direct impact on the software-driven aspects of China's international influence operations, demonstrating that hardware chokepoints are insufficient to contain threats that are increasingly defined by algorithms and data.  [31]      7.3 Recommendations for Western Policymakers To adapt to this evolving landscape, Western policy must become more dynamic, comprehensive, and strategic. Refine and Dynamically Update Controls:  The current control architecture requires continuous maintenance. Technical performance thresholds must be dynamically updated to close loopholes exploited by \"workaround\" chips designed by US firms for the Chinese market.  [6]   Enforcement efforts must be intensified, with a greater focus on targeting the transshipment hubs and financial networks that facilitate Russian sanctions evasion.  [13]      Address the Mature-Node Challenge:  The West urgently needs a coherent industrial strategy to counter China's impending dominance in mature-node semiconductors. This does not necessarily mean matching Chinese subsidies dollar-for-dollar, but it should involve targeted incentives for domestic production of critical legacy chips (e.g., for automotive and defense sectors), diversification of supply chains away from China, and potential trade defense tools to counter unfair pricing practices.  [24]      Compete Beyond Hardware:  Policymakers must recognize that the technology competition with China is not solely about hardware. A comprehensive strategy must include: Investing in the Full AI Stack:  Massively increasing public and private investment in domestic AI research, talent, and computing infrastructure to maintain a durable lead. Championing Open-Source AI:  Actively promoting and contributing to open-source AI development that is aligned with democratic values. This provides a powerful alternative to China's state-controlled AI ecosystem and helps set global technology standards.  [31]      Establishing AI Governance Norms:  Leading a global coalition to establish norms and standards for AI transparency, including robust watermarking and labeling for AI-generated content, to create a more resilient information environment against disinformation from all sources.  [48]      Strengthen Alliances:  The multilateral nature of the current controls is their greatest strength. The US and its partners must deepen technological cooperation with key allies—particularly Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. This should go beyond coordinating export controls to include joint R&D projects, collaboration on building secure and resilient supply chains, and developing shared frameworks for technology governance.",

The US has significantly expanded its controls on advanced computing chips, supercomputing chips, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, with new rules effective from November 2023 and further updates in December 2024 and January 2025. These restrictions aim to limit China's ability to develop advanced AI and military systems. The EU has also implemented extensive sanctions against Russia, including bans on dual-use goods and advanced technologies, with packages adopted throughout 2023 and 2024, and continuing into 2025.Responses to Restrictions and CircumventionA key insight is that both China and Russia are actively seeking to circumvent these restrictions. China has retaliated by imposing export bans on critical minerals like gallium and germanium, essential for semiconductor manufacturing. There are also indications of these materials reaching the US through third countries. Russia, similarly, is reportedly acquiring sanctioned chips and technologies through intermediaries like Turkey, the UAE, and Kazakhstan, with imports largely returning to pre-war levels. This highlights the challenge of enforcing such broad sanctions.Impact on State Media and Domestic IndustryRegarding China's state media, there are reports of Chinese authorities discouraging the use of Nvidia's H20 chips, even though these were designed specifically for the Chinese market after earlier restrictions. This is driven by data security concerns and a push for domestic alternatives. China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative aims for significant self-sufficiency in semiconductors by 2025, and while it has made progress in some areas and lower-end chips, it remains dependent on imports for cutting-edge technologies and equipment. For Russia, sanctions have severely impacted its access to advanced technology, forcing it to turn to less technologically advanced countries and even cannibalize existing equipment. However, Russia has made some progress in developing its own lithography machines, albeit for older 350nm chip technology, with plans for 130nm by 2026. The overall impact on Russia's technology sector and AI development is expected to be devastating in the long term.Next Steps in ResearchMy next step is to delve deeper into the specific details of these restrictions and their precise impact. I will be browsing the identified articles to extract more granular information on the technologies targeted, the entities affected, and the observed consequences on state media's broadcast technology, surveillance capacity, and international narrative control in both China and Russia. I will also continue to track the progress of their domestic semiconductor industries.Researching websites[csis.orgUnderstanding U.S. Allies' Current Legal Authority to Implement AI ...](https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-us-allies-current-legal-authority-implement-ai-and-semiconductor-export)[aljazeera.comChina raises concerns over Nvidia's H20 chips with local firms ...](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/8/12/china-raises-concerns-over-nvidias-h20-chips-with-local-firms-report)[2021-2025.state.govThe Impact of Sanctions and Export Controls on the Russian ...](https://2021-2025.state.gov/the-impact-of-sanctions-and-export-controls-on-the-russian-federation/)[semicone.comRussia's First 350nm Lithography Machine - Semicon electronics](https://www.semicone.com/article-181.html)[sanctionsmap.euRussia - Print Table](https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/api/v1/pdf/regime?id%5B%5D=26&include%5B%5D=lists&lang=en)[cna.org(U) A Technological Divorce: The impact of sanctions and ... - CNA.org.](https://www.cna.org/archive/CNA_Files/pdf/a%20technological-divorce-the-impact-of-sanctions-and-the-end-of-cooperation-on-russias-technology-and-ai-sector.pdf)[economicsobservatory.comWhat's happening in China's semiconductor industry? - Economics ...](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/whats-happening-in-chinas-semiconductor-industry)[nortonrosefulbright.comUS expands export restrictions on advanced semiconductors ...](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/de-de/wissen/publications/5a936192/us-expands-export-restrictions-on-advanced-semiconductors)Deepening Understanding of Semiconductor RestrictionsI've gained a more granular understanding of the semiconductor export restrictions. For China, the US controls, updated in October 2023 and December 2024/January 2025, specifically target advanced computing and supercomputing chips, as well as manufacturing equipment, with detailed performance thresholds. These measures also include expanded geographic scope and the 'foreign direct product rule' to prevent circumvention. For Russia, the EU's sanctions, progressively imposed since 2014 and significantly expanded after February 2022, broadly prohibit the export of dual-use goods and advanced technologies, including those that could contribute to military and technological enhancement. While the EU has adopted numerous packages, I still need to pinpoint the exact regulations pertaining specifically to semiconductors within the specified timeframe.Impact on China's State Media and SurveillanceA new insight for China is the direct pressure from Chinese authorities on domestic companies, including state-controlled media, to avoid foreign chips like Nvidia's H20 due to data security concerns. This is accelerating China's push for domestic alternatives and is being amplified by state media criticism of foreign chips. However, I still need to find specific details on how this has impacted the *broadcast technology* used by state media, such as equipment upgrades or the adoption of advanced production techniques like AI and VR. The impact on China's *surveillance capacity* due to chip shortages remains a significant information gap, and I need to conduct more targeted searches on this.Russia's Semiconductor Challenges and Domestic ProgressFor Russia, I've confirmed that sanctions have severely impacted its access to advanced technology, leading to reliance on less advanced countries and even cannibalization of existing equipment. A notable development is Russia's success in assembling its first domestically produced 350nm lithography machine in May 2024, with plans for 130nm by 2026. While this is a step towards self-reliance, 350nm technology is considered outdated for mainstream applications, highlighting the significant technological gap. I still need to understand the specific *operational impact* on Russian state media and how technology restrictions have affected Russia's *domestic surveillance apparatus*.Addressing Information Gaps and Next StepsMy next steps will focus on filling the identified information gaps. I will conduct targeted searches for specific reports on the technological infrastructure of Chinese state media, the impact of chip shortages on China's surveillance projects, and detailed EU regulations on semiconductor sanctions against Russia. I will also look for information on the operational challenges faced by Russian state media and the effects on Russia's domestic surveillance capabilities. Finally, I will begin to investigate how limited access to advanced semiconductors has influenced the *methods and effectiveness* of international narrative control for both countries, particularly regarding the use of AI-driven content generation and dissemination.Researching websites[wilsoncenter.orgThe Scanning Empire: How China is Building a Global Web of Digital Control](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/scanning-empire-how-china-building-global-web-digital-control)[en.wikipedia.orgTelevision in China -

While the EU has adopted numerous packages, I still need to pinpoint the exact regulations pertaining specifically to semiconductors within the specified timeframe.Impact on China's State Media and SurveillanceA new insight for China is the direct pressure from Chinese authorities on domestic companies, including state-controlled media, to avoid foreign chips like Nvidia's H20 due to data security concerns. This is accelerating China's push for domestic alternatives and is being amplified by state media criticism of foreign chips. However, I still need to find specific details on how this has impacted the *broadcast technology* used by state media, such as equipment upgrades or the adoption of advanced production techniques like AI and VR. The impact on China's *surveillance capacity* due to chip shortages remains a significant information gap, and I need to conduct more targeted searches on this.Russia's Semiconductor Challenges and Domestic ProgressFor Russia, I've confirmed that sanctions have severely impacted its access to advanced technology, leading to reliance on less advanced countries and even cannibalization of existing equipment. A notable development is Russia's success in assembling its first domestically produced 350nm lithography machine in May 2024, with plans for 130nm by 2026. While this is a step towards self-reliance, 350nm technology is considered outdated for mainstream applications, highlighting the significant technological gap. I still need to understand the specific *operational impact* on Russian state media and how technology restrictions have affected Russia's *domestic surveillance apparatus*.Addressing Information Gaps and Next StepsMy next steps will focus on filling the identified information gaps. I will conduct targeted searches for specific reports on the technological infrastructure of Chinese state media, the impact of chip shortages on China's surveillance projects, and detailed EU regulations on semiconductor sanctions against Russia. I will also look for information on the operational challenges faced by Russian state media and the effects on Russia's domestic surveillance capabilities. Finally, I will begin to investigate how limited access to advanced semiconductors has influenced the *methods and effectiveness* of international narrative control for both countries, particularly regarding the use of AI-driven content generation and dissemination.Researching websites[rand.orgFull Stack: China's Evolving Industrial Policy for AI | RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA4012-1.html)[atlanticcouncil.orgHow the Chip Security Act could usher in an era of 'trusted trade ...](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/geotech-cues/how-the-chip-security-act-could-usher-in-an-era-of-trusted-trade-with-us-partners/)[denmark.dlapiper.comEU's 14th package of sanctions against Russia | DLA Piper](https://denmark.dlapiper.com/en/news/eus-14th-package-sanctions-against-russia)[united24media.comDespite EU Sanctions, Kremlin Propaganda Remains Online Across ...](https://united24media.com/latest-news/despite-eu-sanctions-kremlin-propaganda-remains-online-across-europe-investigation-finds-10519)[therecord.mediaRussia's vast telecom surveillance system crippled by withdrawal of ...](https://therecord.media/russia-telecommunications-sorm-surveillance-western-technology)[chinadaily.com.cnEfforts upgrading TV services bear fruit - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202502/27/WS67c0614ea310c240449d7afb.html)[geoecohub.geChinese media industry earnings grow by 8.3% to RMB3.15tr ...](https://geoecohub.ge/en/2025/01/05/chinese-media-industry-earnings-grow-by-8-3-to-rmb3-15tr/)[ketagalanmedia.comChina's Digital Propaganda Machinery: How Beijing is Reshaping ...](https://ketagalanmedia.com/2025/03/31/chinas-digital-propaganda-machinery-how-beijing-is-reshaping-the-global-discourse-in-the-2020s/)[ssoar.infowww.ssoar.info Can Russia's SORM Weather the Sanctions Storm?](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/88681/ssoar-russanald-2023-298-wilde-Can_Russias_SORM_Weather_the.pdf?sequence=1)Semiconductor Export Controls OverviewI've gathered a comprehensive understanding of the semiconductor export restrictions. The US has significantly expanded its controls on advanced computing chips and manufacturing equipment targeting China, with new rules and updates implemented from October 2023 through January 2025. These measures include specific performance thresholds and the 'foreign direct product rule' to prevent circumvention. For Russia, the EU has imposed extensive sanctions since 2014, significantly broadened after February 2022, which prohibit the export of dual-use goods and advanced technologies. The latest EU packages, including the 14th, further enhance these restrictions, with specific measures like an import ban on helium and a 'no Russia' clause for intellectual property transfers.China's Response and Domestic ProgressA key insight is China's proactive response to these restrictions. Chinese authorities are actively discouraging the use of foreign chips, even those specifically designed for their market like Nvidia's H20, citing data security concerns. This is fueling a strong push for domestic alternatives, with state media amplifying criticism of foreign chips. China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative aims for significant semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025, and while progress has been made in lower-end chips and certain manufacturing processes, the country remains reliant on imports for cutting-edge technologies and equipment. There's also evidence of China retaliating with export bans on critical minerals like gallium and germanium, though some of these materials are still reaching the US through third countries.Russia's Challenges and Circumvention EffortsFor Russia, the sanctions have severely impacted its access to advanced technology, leading to reliance on less technologically advanced countries and even the cannibalization of existing equipment. Despite these challenges, Russia is actively working to circumvent sanctions, reportedly acquiring chips and technologies through intermediaries like Turkey, the UAE, and Kazakhstan. While Russia has made some progress in developing its own 350nm lithography machine, with plans for 130nm by 2026, this technology is considered outdated for mainstream applications, highlighting a significant technological gap. The overall impact on Russia's technology sector and AI development is expected to be substantial in the long term.Impact on Surveillance and Narrative ControlI've found strong evidence that export controls are creating a 'compute constrained' environment for Chinese AI firms, which could impact surveillance projects. China is also leveraging AI, including its own models, for international propaganda and influence operations, with high-performance GPUs being smuggled into the country to support these efforts. For Russia, the withdrawal of Western technology is significantly crippling its domestic surveillance capabilities, particularly impacting systems like SORM. While Russian state media is circumventing online sanctions to maintain reach, I need to investigate how technology restrictions are affecting the sophistication of their information operations, especially concerning AI-driven content.Next Research StepsMy next steps will focus on addressing the remaining information gaps. I will conduct targeted searches to find direct links between semiconductor restrictions and the technological capabilities of China's state media and surveillance apparatus, looking for specific examples of delays or scaling back of projects. For Russia, I will seek more information on the internal operational impact on state media, such as equipment shortages or production challenges, and further details on their domestic semiconductor production capacity. Finally, I will begin to synthesize the information on both countries' international narrative control efforts, comparing their use of technology and analyzing how differing access to advanced semiconductors might be creating a divergence in their capabilities.Researching websites[fing.comThe Dahua & Hikvision controversy: how it affects your network privacy -

DataCube Research](https://www.datacuberesearch.com/russia-semiconductor-market)Comprehensive Understanding of Semiconductor RestrictionsI have now gathered a comprehensive understanding of the semiconductor export restrictions impacting China and Russia. For China, the US has implemented and updated extensive controls on advanced computing chips and manufacturing equipment, with specific performance thresholds and measures to prevent circumvention. For Russia, the EU has imposed broad sanctions on dual-use goods and advanced technologies, with numerous packages enacted since 2022, including specific measures to prevent circumvention and restrict intellectual property transfers.China's Strategic Response and Domestic ProgressA key insight is China's strategic response to these restrictions, which includes actively discouraging the use of foreign chips, even those designed for their market, due to data security concerns. This has accelerated their push for domestic alternatives, with state media supporting this narrative. China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative aims for significant semiconductor self-sufficiency, and while progress has been made in certain areas and lower-end chips, the country still relies on imports for cutting-edge technologies. China has also retaliated with export bans on critical minerals, though some circumvention through third countries has been observed.Russia's Challenges and Limited Domestic CapabilitiesFor Russia, the sanctions have severely impacted its access to advanced technology, leading to reliance on less advanced countries and the repurposing of existing equipment. While Russia is attempting to circumvent sanctions through intermediaries, its domestic semiconductor industry remains significantly behind, with its first domestically produced lithography machine capable of only outdated 350nm chip technology. This highlights a substantial technological gap compared to global standards.Impact on Surveillance and Narrative ControlI've found strong evidence that export controls are creating a 'compute constrained' environment for Chinese AI firms, which has implications for surveillance projects. China is actively using AI, including its own models, for international propaganda, with high-performance GPUs being smuggled to support these efforts. For Russia, the withdrawal of Western technology is significantly degrading its domestic surveillance capabilities, particularly impacting systems like SORM. While Russian state media is circumventing online sanctions to maintain reach, their technological approach to information warfare appears less sophisticated than China's, likely due to their more limited access to advanced technology.Synthesizing Research for Final ReportI have now reached a point of saturation in my research and possess sufficient information to synthesize a comprehensive report. I will now proceed to analyze and compare the situations in China and Russia, highlighting their distinct levels of technological resilience and adaptation strategies in response to semiconductor export restrictions. My report will address the impact on state media's broadcast technology, surveillance capacity, and international narrative control for both countries, providing a nuanced analysis of the direct and indirect effects of these restrictions.",
